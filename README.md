# Python-Image-Based-Convertor

Overview
The Python-Based Image Converter is a simple yet effective tool for transforming color images into grayscale. This project leverages OpenCV's cv2.imread() method to perform the conversion, showcasing image processing techniques and proficiency in Python programming.

Features
Converts color images to grayscale.
Utilizes OpenCV library for image processing.
Demonstrates basic image manipulation techniques.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2 module)
Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from Python's official website.

Install the OpenCV library. You can do this using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-converter.git
cd image-converter
Place the color image you want to convert in the project directory.

Run the convert_to_grayscale.py script:

bash
Copy code
python convert_to_grayscale.py <input_image> <output_image>
Replace <input_image> with the filename of your color image and <output_image> with the desired filename for the grayscale image.

Example
bash
Copy code
python convert_to_grayscale.py color_image.jpg grayscale_image.jpg
This will convert color_image.jpg to a grayscale image and save it as grayscale_image.jpg.

Code Explanation
The main script convert_to_grayscale.py includes the following steps:

Imports the necessary modules.
Reads the input image using cv2.imread().
Converts the image to grayscale using cv2.cvtColor().
Saves the grayscale image using cv2.imwrite().
