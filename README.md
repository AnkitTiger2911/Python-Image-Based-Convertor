# Python-Based Image Converter
Overview
The Python-Based Image Converter is a simple yet effective tool for transforming color images into grayscale. This project leverages OpenCV's cv2.imread() method to perform the conversion, showcasing image processing techniques and proficiency in Python programming.

# Features
1. Converts color images to grayscale.
2. Utilizes OpenCV library for image processing.
3. Demonstrates basic image manipulation techniques.

# Install the OpenCV library. You can do this using pip:
pip install opencv-python`

# Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine: 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-converter.gitcd image-converter
2. Place the color image you want to convert in the project directory.
3. Run the convert_to_grayscale.py script:
python convert_to_grayscale.py <input_image> <output_image>
4. This will convert color_image.jpg to a grayscale image and save it as grayscale_image.jpg.
python convert_to_grayscale.py color_image.jpg grayscale_image.jpg






# Imports the necessary modules.
Reads the input image using cv2.imread().
Converts the image to grayscale using cv2.cvtColor().
Saves the grayscale image using cv2.imwrite().
